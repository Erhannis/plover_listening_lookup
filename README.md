//#DUMMY

This is a Plover plugin that listens to normal keyboard keypresses and gives suggested strokes for each detected word, as though you were typing into the built-in Lookup window.  Intended for learners to get a feel for words while still typing normally.

Warning: this does listen to your keyboard (as does Plover), so you might want to e.g. minimize or close it before typing any passwords.

Based off https://github.com/Kaoffie/plover_next_stroke .  There might be some leftover code I missed.
